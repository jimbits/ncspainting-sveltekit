## Clean lines. Smooth walls. A home that feels refreshed.

A fresh interior paint job can transform a space faster than almost any upgrade—brightening rooms, modernizing color, and making your home feel clean and updated. The difference between an “okay” paint job and a professional finish usually comes down to **prep, protection, and detail work**.

At **NCS Painting**, we focus on the things homeowners notice every day: smooth walls, consistent coverage, crisp edges on trim, and a work area that stays tidy from start to finish.

## What’s included (prep + finish)

Interior projects succeed when surfaces are prepared properly and your home is protected throughout the process. Our typical scope includes:

1. **Protect floors and furniture** with coverings and careful masking
2. **Light patching and sanding** for small dings and surface imperfections
3. **Caulking / sealing** where needed around trim transitions
4. **Priming** to improve adhesion and even out coverage (especially over repairs or color changes)
5. **Clean cut lines** at ceilings, corners, and trim edges
6. **Even coats + consistent sheen** to avoid flashing and patchiness
7. **Daily tidy-up** and a final walkthrough to confirm details

> If you’re unsure about sheen, we can recommend options that balance durability and appearance for each room.

## Interior painting FAQs (Edmonton)

### How much does it cost to paint a room in Edmonton?

Pricing depends on room size, ceiling height, prep requirements, and paint selection. The fastest way to get an accurate number is a walkthrough estimate.

### How long does interior painting take?

Some single rooms can be completed quickly, while whole-home projects take longer. Prep and dry times can affect timelines—especially with patching and priming.

### Do you move furniture or should we?

We can coordinate a plan during the estimate. Many homeowners move small items in advance, and we help with careful protection and positioning for larger pieces.

### What paint sheen should I choose?

Higher-traffic areas often benefit from more washable finishes, while ceilings typically use flatter sheens. We’ll recommend based on the room and how it’s used.
