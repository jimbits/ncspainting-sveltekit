## A kitchen upgrade without the full renovation price tag

If your cabinets are solid but look dated, worn, or yellowed, **cabinet painting** is one of the highest-impact upgrades you can make. New cabinet doors and full replacement often cost significantly more and can create weeks of disruption. Professional cabinet painting gives you the modern look you want—clean color, smoother finish, refreshed hardware—while keeping your existing cabinet boxes and layout.

At **NCS Painting**, our cabinet work is built around what actually makes cabinets look “factory-finished”: **thorough degreasing, careful sanding, proper priming, and durable topcoats**. We don’t treat cabinets like walls. Cabinets get touched daily, cleaned often, and take constant wear. That’s why prep and coating selection matter more than almost anything else.

## What we paint and refinish

## What’s included (prep + finish)

A long-lasting cabinet finish comes from doing the “unseen” steps correctly. Your project typically includes:

1. **Protection and masking** for floors, counters, appliances, and nearby surfaces
2. **Door/drawer removal + labeling** so everything returns to the right place
3. **Degreasing and cleaning** to remove oils, cooking residue, and buildup
4. **Sanding / scuffing** to create a surface the coating can bond to
5. **Bonding primer** chosen for cabinet substrates and stain-blocking where needed
6. **Durable finish coats** for a smooth look and better washability
7. **Reassembly + hardware reinstall** and a final walkthrough

> Pro tip: “Paint + primer in one” is rarely a good cabinet strategy. Cabinets typically need a dedicated bonding primer for reliable adhesion.

## Our cabinet painting process

### 1) Estimate and finish planning

We confirm scope (kitchen, vanity, built-ins), surface type, current condition, and your desired look. We also discuss sheen, color, and any hardware updates.

### 2) Prep and setup

We protect surrounding areas, remove doors/drawers, clean thoroughly, and prep surfaces so coatings bond properly.

### 3) Prime and paint

We apply primer and finish coats with the goal of a smooth, consistent result—no rough patches, no heavy brush marks, and no uneven sheen.

### 4) Cure, reassemble, and walkthrough

Cabinets need time to cure. We’ll provide simple care guidelines, reinstall doors/drawers, and do a final detail check with you.

## Durability: what to expect

A professional cabinet coating system is designed to handle daily use—touching, wiping, and cleaning. That said, cabinets still benefit from good habits:

- Avoid harsh abrasives or aggressive scrub pads
- Use gentle cleaners during the first cure period
- Add felt pads and soft-close adjustments where needed

We’ll recommend coatings and care practices based on how your kitchen is used (busy family home vs. light use).

## FAQs

### How long does cabinet painting take?

Timelines depend on cabinet size, prep needs, and cure requirements. We’ll provide a clear schedule during your quote.

### Do I need to empty my cabinets?

Usually, yes—at least the areas being worked on. We’ll tell you exactly what to remove and what can stay.

### Will my cabinets look smooth?

Our goal is a clean, professional finish. The final look depends on door style, existing condition, and coating selection—these are all reviewed during the estimate.

### Can you paint laminate cabinets?

Some laminate and non-porous surfaces can be painted with the right bonding primer and process. We’ll confirm feasibility during inspection.
