## Proper prep. Durable coatings. A clean, lasting exterior.

Edmonton weather can be hard on a home’s exterior—sun, wind, freeze/thaw cycles, and moisture all take a toll on paint and siding. If your exterior looks faded, chalky, peeling, or uneven, a professional repaint does more than improve curb appeal. It helps **protect siding and trim**, reduce moisture intrusion around joints, and extend the life of your exterior surfaces.

At **NCS Painting**, we approach exterior projects with a “prep-first” mindset. Great exterior results come from the right combination of **surface preparation, compatible primers, and premium exterior coatings**—applied carefully and finished with crisp detail work.

## Surfaces we paint (exterior)

We paint and refresh the most common exterior materials found across Edmonton neighbourhoods:

- **Vinyl siding** (proper cleaning + bonding where required)
- **Stucco** (breathable coatings, careful coverage)
- **Wood siding + trim** (repair-focused prep, sealing, priming)
- **Metal siding** (rust treatment + proper primers where needed)
- **Soffits, fascia, eavestrough trim, doors, and accents**

If you’re not sure what your exterior is made of, we’ll confirm during your estimate and recommend the best coating system for that surface.

## What’s included (prep + protection)

Exterior paint lasts longer when the prep is done right. Our standard scope typically includes:

1. **Cleaning / surface wash** as required to remove dirt, chalking, and debris
2. **Scraping and sanding** where paint is loose or flaking
3. **Caulking and sealing** joints and gaps to reduce water intrusion
4. **Spot priming / full priming** based on surface condition and coating needs
5. **Masking and protection** for windows, brick, concrete, lighting, and landscaping
6. **Premium exterior coatings** for durability and color retention
7. **Detail work and tidy cleanup** with a final walkthrough

> Tip: If you’re comparing quotes, ask what prep is included. “One coat and go” often fails early—especially in harsh climates.

## Our exterior painting process

### 1) Estimate + inspection

We assess your surfaces, highlight problem areas (peeling zones, water staining, failing caulk), and define a clear scope.

### 2) Prep + minor repairs

We focus on adhesion and sealing: clean, scrape/sand, caulk, and prime where needed so the finish bonds properly.

### 3) Painting + detail work

We apply the correct coating for the surface and conditions, maintain even coverage, and keep edges clean around trim and transitions.

### 4) Walkthrough + cleanup

We do a final check, handle touch-ups, remove masking, and leave the site neat and ready to enjoy.
